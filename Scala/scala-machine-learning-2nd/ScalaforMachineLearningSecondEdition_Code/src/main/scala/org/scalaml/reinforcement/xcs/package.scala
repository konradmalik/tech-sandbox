/**
 * This package object encapsulates the skeleton for the implementation of the
 * extended learning classifiers (XCS) using the following classes:
 *
 * - Actions triggered following the matching and selection of the most
 * appropriate rules '''XcsAction'''
 *
 * - Rules defined as {predicate, action} and comprising the search space or
 * knowledge base '''XcsRule'''
 *
 * - Singleton to generate new rule (predicate, action) if no match for the current
 * state/condition (predicate) of the environment exists  '''XcsCover'''
 *
 * - Sensor or input event (condition met) generated by the environment '''XcsSensor'''
 *
 * - Skeleton of the implementation of the XCS algorithm '''Xcs'''
