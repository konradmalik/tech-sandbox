 * - Genetic chromosome defined as a list of Gene with a symbolic representation of list of

 * '''
 *
 * - Genetic Gene defined in binary format with a symbolic representation of predicates
 *  '''Gene'''
 *
 * - Chromosome pool or population managed by genetic operator such as selection, mutation
 * and cross-over '''Population'''
 *
 * - Reproduction cycle (selection, cross-over, mutation with exit conditions
 * '''Reproduction'''
 *
 * - Genetic Algorithm solver '''GASolver'''
