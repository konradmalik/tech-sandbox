/**
 * Define a trading signal as used in technical analysis of financial markets. A partial

 * implemented as chromosomes of a genetic algorithm.
 *
 * A trading signal is emitted once a value (or data point) in a time series reaches a
 * threshold (upward or downward movement).
 * {{{
 * A signal is triggers when x(n) > target value or x(n) < target value
 * }}}
 * The class assume that a digitization function that discrete a continuous value is defined
 * implicitly.
 * @constructor Create a trading signal used for analyzing changes in variables derived from
 * the price and trading volume of a security.
 * @param id Label or identifier for the trading signal
 * @param target Target value (or threshold) used to trigger the signal.
 * @param op Operator that is used to defined the condition such as greater than, equals....
 * @param xt  Times series of single variable the signal acts upon.
 * @param weights Weights applied to each value of the time series (optional).
 * @param quant Quantization function that convert analog or continuous signal to a
