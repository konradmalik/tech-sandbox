/**
 * This package object encapsulates some basic applications of the Akka framework. The
 * different configurations to illustrate basic usage of Akka actors and futures are:
 *
 * - Generic controller for distributed computation '''Controller'''
 *
 * - Class to split or partition time series for concurrent processing '''Partitioner'''
 *
 * - Implementation of basic Master-workers pattern '''Worker''' and '''Master'''
 *
 * - Master-worker design with a supervising router '''MasteWithRouter'''
 *
 * - Implementation of futures with blocking of the client actor to distribute the
 * computation of the Discrete Fourier transform'''TransformFutures'''
 *
 * - Implementation of futures with callback to the client actor to distribute the
 *  computation of the Discrete Fourier transform'''TransformFuturesClbck'''
 *
 * @see Scala for Machine Learning Chapter 16 Parallelism with Scala and akka
 * @note The name of the Akka actor routing protocol has been changed in version 2.3.x
