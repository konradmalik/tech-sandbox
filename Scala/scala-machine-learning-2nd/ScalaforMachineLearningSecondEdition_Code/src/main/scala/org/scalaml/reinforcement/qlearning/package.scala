/**
 * This package object encapsulates implementation of Q-learning algorithms. It is
 * defined by the following classes
 *
 * - State transition actions '''QLAction'''
 *
 * - Configuration parameters for the execution the Q-learning algorithm (training and
 * state prediction) '''QLConfig'''
 *
 * - State and its associated actions '''QLState'''
 *
 * - Search space of all states and state transitions '''QLSpace'''
 *
 * - Policy defines as the value, probability and reward matrices '''QLPolicy'''
 *
 * - Model generated through training containing the most rewarding policy and training
 * coverage '''QLModel'''
 *
 * - Probability and reward input to policy '''QLInput'''
 *
 * - Q-learning algorithm for the generation of the optimum policy and prediction for
 * next state '''QLearning'''
